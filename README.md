# image-Pixel-encryption-tool
A Python image encryption tool that applies pixel-level encryption techniques such as: 
- Pixel value manipulation.
- Key-based mathematical transformations. 
- Basic pixel swapping.
The project demonstrates how simple cryptographic concepts can be implemented using Python and Pillow.
